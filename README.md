# Developing a Pokedex
In the world of one of the most notorious animations/video games, Pokemon, there is a fundamental electronic gadget in the journey of a future Pokemon master. It is the Pokedex and it catalogues every detail about each of the world’s creature. Now, let’s bring this technology to our smartphones.

Your task is to develop a Pokedex, providing a smart usability to its users as well as detailing some information about the Pokemons. We expect that your app allows us to:

- list Pokemons
- search Pokemon by their names
- see details from the selected Pokemon, including name, photo and other details you consider relevant

You can consume the data from Pokemon’s public APIs, [pokeapi](<https://pokeapi.co/>).

## Your solution

Your solution must be written in [Flutter](<https://flutter.dev/>) and work for both Android and iOS. If you have any prerequisites to execute the solution, please identify them on the project’s README.

## Tips
Feel free to choose the design you prefer (perhaps even a retro one?). Here are some references to inspire you:
